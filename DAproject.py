#In this Project ,I am  analyzing online education aspects and I have uploaded my data (udemy.csv) and i'll answer these Questions (i have answered these Questions in graphs' title only):
#1.	Which course categories (e.g., tech, business, arts) are the most popular?
#2.	Is there a correlation between course price and ratings?
#3.	What are the trends in student completion rates?
#4.	What factors affect studentsâ€™ performance (e.g., study hours, age group)?
#5.	Which regions or demographics engage more in online learning?
